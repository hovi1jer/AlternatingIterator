# McKessonSamples

There are two folders each containing my solution to one of the the two problems provided by McKesson.

The first folder, AlternatingIterator is an Eclipse Java8 project that contains an implementation for the AlternatingIterator interface and test cases to ensure the expected functionality.

	To run the test cases:
		1) Clone the McKessonSamples repository
		2) Import the AlternatingIterator into Eclipse
		3) Locate the AlternatingIteratorTest.java call in the src/mckesson/iterator directory
		4) Right click the AlternatingIteratorTest.java -> Run As -> JUnit Test

The second folder, McKessonRestApi is an Eclipse Spring Boot Java8 project that contains an implementation of a single rest end point that allows a user to added and test cases to ensure the expected functionality.
